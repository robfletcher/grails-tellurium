# Backlog

## Bugs

## For next release

 * Fix use of custom config (currently just passing `null`)
 * Ensure not bundled with war
 * Test with Jetty
 * Scaffold modules
 * Remote mode for running without starting the app
 * Override tellurium config with system properties, e.g. browser
 * Enable use of data-driven tests
 * Figure out how Tellurium starts the Selenium server & do it the same way (may not always want to start it)

## Roadmap
